A Software Engineering Project 

An easy to use portal to book slots for a specific workstation or console on a specific time is presented in the project. Many times it is tough for customers and the staff to manage slots on site or through calls, thus this portal aims to solve this problem first by giving a transparent view of all the workstations and consoles available and their availability. It makes it easier for the staff and manager to manage all the logistics involved and a place to view the status and problems in the cafe at any point of time.
